This repository contains the instances that I used for the computations in my dissertation

## Optimal Graph Coverings with Connected Subgraphs

submitted in 2023 to the Freie Universit√§t Berlin.

---

The instances for the Balanced, Rooted, and Capacitated Maximum Weight Connected Subgraph Problem (BRCMWCS) that is considered in Chapter 5 of the dissertation are located in the corresponding folder. Analogously to the dissertation, the instances are split into four groups: voronoi, large voronoi, sparse voronoi, and grid instances.

The instances for the Toll Section Design Problem (TSDP) which is the subject of Chapter 6 can also be found in the respective folder. We cannot share the real-world instances, but provide the instances for the line graphs of trees as well as medium and large voronoi instances.
